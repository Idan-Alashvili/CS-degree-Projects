# CS Projects Folder

This repository contains various projects developed during my computer science studies, showcasing skills in multiple programming languages and disciplines, including object-oriented programming, systems programming, and data science.

## Projects

### 1. **Mini-Interpreter (Python)**
   - A custom interpreter project built using Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations, boolean logic, and string manipulation. The interpreter includes features for variable handling, attribute access, and custom functions.
   - The project explores the fundamentals of programming languages, including syntax parsing, evaluation, and interpretation.

### 2. **Java OOP Projects**
   - A collection of object-oriented programming (OOP) projects completed during the semester. These Java projects focus on various OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
   - Each project showcases the use of design patterns and principles in building robust and maintainable software.

### 3. **Producer-Consumer (C)**
   - Implemented a producer-consumer model using shared memory and synchronization.
   - Focus on inter-process communication and concurrency.
   - Applied semaphores and mutex locks to avoid race conditions.

### 4. **Client-Server with Data (C++)**
  - A client-server architecture project implemented in C++ using TCP/IP sockets.
  - The server processes graph traversal queries from the client and computes the shortest path between two nodes using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
  - The client sends vertex IDs to the server and displays the received shortest path.  
  - Includes advanced data structures and optimizations for better performance.

### 5. **Handball League Table Prediction (Data Science, Python)**
  - A Data Science project that predicts handball league standings using player statistics. The project involves building and training a Random Forest Regressor model that predicts team success based on player stats.
  - The data was carefully scraped from the official Handball Bundesliga website and transformed into CSV files. includes player-level statistics, and the model is trained on historical data to predict future standings.
  - The project emphasizes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation (using Mean Absolute Error and R-squared).

## Requirements

Each project has its own dependencies. Please refer to the README files inside each project folder for detailed setup instructions.

- Python: Required for the mini-interpreter and machine learning projects.
- Java: Required for Java OOP projects.
- GCC/G++: Required for the C and C++ projects.
